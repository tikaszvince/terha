TErHa - Templatable PHP  Error Handler class
Require PHP > 5.2

Original idea from Tyrael (https://github.com/Tyrael/php-error-handler)
 
Error handler which can provide you an easy way to handle errors even non
recoverable errors like E_ERROR, E_PARSE, E_CORE_ERROR, E_COMPILE_ERROR.
 
It wraps the error to an ErrorException instance and throws the
exception (for catchable errors) or calls the default exception handler (for
fatal errors.

BEWARE: you cannot continue the execution of your script on such errors, but
with this script, you can gracefully terminate.

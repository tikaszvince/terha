TErHa - Templatable PHP  Error Handler class
============================================

Original idea from Tyrael (https://github.com/Tyrael/php-error-handler)

 
Error handler which can provide you an easy way to handle errors even non
recoverable errors like `E_ERROR`, `E_PARSE`, `E_CORE_ERROR`, `E_COMPILE_ERROR`.
 
It wraps the error to an ErrorException instance and throws the
exception (for catchable errors) or calls the default exception handler (for
fatal errors.

BEWARE: you cannot continue the execution of your script on such errors, but
with this script, you can gracefully terminate.

Requirements
------------
Require PHP > 5.2
For SQLite loging You need PDO_SQLITE

Setup
=====
Include errorhandler.php to Your code. In this case you can ready to use error
handler in developer mode.

Available Profiles
==================
With profiles you can setup error display, log or reporting configurations, and 
also the error page.

## Dev
With *dev* profile every error will be displayed, and logged into a text file under
`logs/dev/` directory. Every day new `error-{date}.log` file will be created.

In *dev* mode, error handler not send reporting mail. Triggered errors not displayed
at the place where triggered but the end of generated page with trace in HTML mode,
covered with an HTML `div` element.

If there is no other option than display error page `profiles/dev/layout.php` will be
use as template.

## Test
With *test* profile every error will be displayed, and logged into a text file under
`logs/test/` directory. Every day new `error-{date}.log` file will be created.

In *test* mode, error handler not send reporting mail. Triggered errors not displayed
at the place where triggered but the end of generated page with trace in text mode,
covered in a HTML comment block

If there is no other option than display error page `profiles/dev/layout.ph`p will be
use as template (the same as in *dev* mode).

## Prod
With *prod* profile no errors will be displayed, but logged into an SQLite database
under `logs/prod/` directory. Every day new `error-{date}.sqlite.db` file will be created.

In *prod* mode, error handler send reporting mail in every 60 minutes.
Logged error text will be contains trace, blank text.

If there is no other option than display error page `profiles/prod/layout.php` will be
use as template.
